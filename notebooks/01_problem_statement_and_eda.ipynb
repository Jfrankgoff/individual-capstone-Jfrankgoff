    "\n",
    "1. **NO AI TOOLS**: You may **NOT** use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, or any other AI assistant to generate code for this assignment. The goal is to build *your* fundamental skills. If you rely on AI now, the advanced topics later will be impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Study Groups Encouraged**: You **ARE** encouraged to discuss ideas, share approaches, and explain concepts to your study group peers. Teaching others is the best way to learn! However, the code you submit must be **your own work**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Your Resources**: You are free to use Google, StackOverflow, Pandas/Scikit-learn documentation, and your class notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comment Your Code**: Include comments explaining *why* you're doing what you're doing. I want to see your thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resubmission**: You may submit this assignment multiple times for feedback before each checkpoint deadline.\n",

    "## Important: Written Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, you'll see text cells asking you to explain your decisions, observations, and reasoning. **These written reflections are a critical part of your grade.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't just write one-word answers or skip these sections. Your reflections demonstrate:\n",
    "- Your understanding of the data science process\n",
    "- Your ability to communicate findings to stakeholders\n",
    "- Your critical thinking about data quality and feature importance\n",

Engineers can be tasked with designing components made of materials that are less likely to have defects. \n",

    "I suspect NickelComposition, IronComposition, CobaltComposition and ChromiumComposition will be the most meaningful features. Other features of interest are QuenchDuration, ForgeDuration and FormationMethod. I hypothesize ComponentType and StructureType will be less valuable but these should still be explored. Our analysis could reveal defect patterns that could be addressed for all of these features. "

After initial review, I believe PredictedHours, MinorDefects, MajorDefects and EdgeDefects to be potential candidates for target variables, even though for this project I have chosen to focus on a calculated column called TotalDefects, which will sum the 3 defect types. This leaves a total feature count of 12. Of those 12, 4 are categorical, which means we have 8 numerical features included in the dataset. \n",

    "This dataset contains simulated data for predicting the lifespan (in hours) of materials used in industrial components. It includes a variety of features related to material composition, manufacturing processes, and structural defects. The dataset is ideal for exploring regression techniques, feature engineering, and material sciences applications.\n",

    "StructureType: Microstructural grain configuration.\n",
    "CoolRate: Cooling rate during the manufacturing process.\n",
    "QuenchDuration: Duration of quenching (in seconds).\n",
    "ForgeDuration: Duration of forging (in seconds).\n",
    "HeatProcessTime: Time spent in heat treatment (in minutes).\n",
    "NickelComposition: Percentage of nickel in the material.\n",

    "CobaltComposition: Percentage of cobalt in the material.\n",
    "ChromiumComposition: Percentage of chromium in the material.\n",
    "MinorDefects, MajorDefects, EdgeDefects: Defect counts of different categories.\n",
    "InitialPosition: Initial position of the component (e.g., Top, Bottom).\n",
